    Analyze the following software requirement and create a comprehensive technical specification:
    
    REQUIREMENT:
    {requirement}
    
    Your specification MUST include:
    
    1. PROJECT OVERVIEW
       - Project name and description
       - Core features and scope
       - Technology stack recommendations
    
    2. DATABASE DESIGN
       - Entity definitions with fields and types
       - Relationships between entities
       - Indexes and constraints
       - Sample table names following naming conventions
    
    3. API DESIGN
       - RESTful endpoints with HTTP methods
       - Request/Response schemas
       - Authentication requirements
       - Error handling patterns
    
    4. FRONTEND DESIGN
       - Page/Component structure
       - State management approach
       - API integration points
       - UI/UX considerations
    
    5. NAMING CONVENTIONS
       - Database: snake_case for tables/columns
       - Backend: PascalCase for classes, camelCase for functions
       - Frontend: PascalCase for components, camelCase for functions
    
    Format your output as a structured JSON-like specification that can be parsed
    and used by the engineering team.
    
  expected_output: >
    A detailed technical specification in JSON-like format containing:
    - Project metadata
    - Database schema definitions
    - API endpoint specifications
    - Frontend component hierarchy
    - Clear naming conventions used consistently throughout
