    Perform a comprehensive audit of all generated code and produce a final report.
    
    ORIGINAL REQUIREMENT:
    {requirement}
    
    TECHNICAL PLAN:
    {plan}
    
    DATABASE CODE:
    {database_code}
    
    BACKEND CODE:
    {backend_code}
    
    FRONTEND CODE:
    {frontend_code}
    
    Your audit MUST check:
    
    1. NAMING CONSISTENCY
       - Database table/column names match ORM model attributes
       - API endpoint paths are consistent and RESTful
       - Frontend API calls use correct endpoint paths
       - Variable/function names follow conventions consistently
    
    2. INTEGRATION POINTS
       - Frontend API calls match backend endpoint signatures
       - Backend queries match database schema
       - Data types are consistent across tiers
       - Required fields are properly handled
    
    3. COMPLETENESS
       - All features from the requirement are implemented
       - All CRUD operations are available where needed
       - Error handling is present at all tiers
    
    4. CODE QUALITY
       - Code follows best practices
       - No obvious bugs or anti-patterns
       - Proper typing and documentation
    
    After the audit, use the FileWriteTool to save the code files:
    - Save database code to: dist/database/
    - Save backend code to: dist/backend/
    - Save frontend code to: dist/frontend/
    - Save the final report to: dist/REPORT.md
    
  expected_output: >
    A comprehensive Markdown report containing:
    - Executive summary of the generated software
    - Validation results for each tier
    - Any issues found and recommendations
    - File structure of the saved code
    - Instructions for running the application
    All code files saved to the dist/ folder using FileWriteTool.
